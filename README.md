# Envineering Investigation and Statistical Analysis (CHEE2010)
## Introduction and background information
Engineering at its heart is about decision making, usually in the face of
incomplete data and uncertainty. Observing, measuring, and correcting for
uncertainty is thus a required part of the education of any engineering
student. In this course, we try t ocommunicate statistics and experimentation
as a part of a set of engineering skills, with a focus on quantitative
estimation. That means we use bservation of uncertainty t oinfer impact on
process outputs and parameters. As such, this course is presented in three key
components;
 - observation of uncertainty
 - estimation of process parameters
 - ways to propagate uncertainty through a pipeline of processes
This course integrates lectures, practical computing and laboratory
experimental work using chemical engineering process equipment.

## Course changes
The content within the course will be presented in a more compact manner than
previous years. This is so students can favour pondering, understanding, and
building concepts rather than learning formulae for exams. In order to
facilitate this method of learning, there will be a particular focus on good
housekeeping with respect to data organisation, manipulation, files, and
reusable codes.

## Getting Started
The tutorials will be presented using Jupyter Notebooks.
