# Engineering Investigation and Statistical Analysis (CHEE2010)
## Instructions for running the slides
1. Click on the `index.ipynb` file in the directory.
2. Make sure the eye is greyed out. This hides the generating code. If interested, you can have a look at the code and suggest changes.
3. Select "Kernel" along the top, and select "Restart & Run All
4. Click on the "Enter/Exit RISE Slideshow (the icon which looks like a bar graph).



## Course Structure

### Week 0
We will revisit some of the most important concepts of chemical engineering as
learned in
[CHEE2001](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=CHEE2001)
such as defining system limits, and constructing mass and energy balances. We
will also revisit the mathematical tools required to succeed in this course
including;
 - order of operations (PEDMAS)
 - Review of mass and energy balances
 - abstraction of a function as a map
 - basic calculus
 - basic linear algebra

### Week 1
This is to be done in the first week along. Ideally this session should be done
in addition to the content for [Lesson 01](./Lesson01) in the first teaching
week. The following notions will be covered;
 - Principles of data organisation in spreadsheets: the hard and fast rules
 - Computing terminology
 - Basic statistical terminology
 - Programmatic data organisation using
   [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)

### Week 2
Probability theory and common probability distribution encountered in chemical
engineering.

### Week 3
We will cover point estimation, delve deeper into the Gaussian distribution,
look at the central limit theorem, and begin to construct confidence intervals.

### Week 4
Hypothesis testing will be covered in this week.

### Week 5
ANOVA and design of experiments

### Week 6
Linear regression modelling: how can we quantify a relationship between a
response and its covariate.

### Week 7
We will extend the work from the previous week to generalise to any function
(commonly called hypothesis). We will learn about common cost functions used to
determine parameters of interest.

### Week 8
This will be an off-teaching week. Students will work on their capstone
proposals together during the tutorial session. They will hand in their report
at the end of this teaching week.
